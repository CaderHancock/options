 This is going to be an app to aid me with options trading when "complete". Which will hopefully be (ValveTime)"soon"

  Apart from fun and furthering the dream of living off of algo trading, this project is intended to showcase (some level of) technical ability.
  Please give me feedback regarding design choices as this is an independant study project 

Current milestones:

  -Develop objects and factories for all financial instruments with 100% unit test coverage using junit 5 and mockito
  
  -implement most of current gui design doc (Currently last priority because i'd rather learn junit 5 and mockito instead of a text gui)
  
  -Stock paper trading
  
  -financial formula objects
  
  -find decent, free, easy to implement derivitives data api (Actually kinda hard)
  
  -derivitives paper trading
  
  -algo trading engine
  
  -brokerage account integration
  
  
  
also, i  sometimes like to use a script that pulls commit messages from whatthecommit.com to keep me entertained while working
so please don't judge too harshly UPDATE: I have some idea of what I'm doing now and have actual messages
