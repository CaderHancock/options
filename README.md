This is going to be an app to aid me with options trading when "complete" 

Apart from fun and furthering the dream of living off of algo trading, this project is intended to showcase (some level of) technical ability.

Please give me feedback regarding design choices as this is an independant study project (Ignore driver.java. I may abandon that gui api alltogether.)

Current milestones

  Develop objects and factories for all financial instruments with 100% unit test coverage
  
  
  
  implement most of current gui design doc (Currently last priority because i'd rather learn enterprise libraries instead of a text gui)
  
 
  Stock paper trading
  
  financial formula objects
  
  find decent, free, easy to implement derivitives data api (Actually kinda hard)
  
  derivitives paper trading
  
  algo trading engine
  
  brokerage account integration
  
  
  
also, i like to use a script that pulls commit messages from whatthecommit.com to keep me entertained while working
so please don't judge too harshly 
"meaningful" commit messages are usually in ALLCAPS
